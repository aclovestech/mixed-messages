# Mixed Messages
This project was developed as part of the Codecademy learning experience, specifically within the Full-Stack Engineer path.

### A JavaScript project that acts as a message generator program.
Running the program will give a random message of the day.
A message of the day consists of a Bible verse, a prayer, and an uplifting message.

### Sample Output
```
Bible Verse:
2 Timothy 1:7 - "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind."

Dear Lord, I ask for Your protection over myself and my loved ones today. Shield us from harm and negativity, and fill our hearts with joy and peace. May we find comfort in Your presence throughout the day. Amen.

Keep in mind...
Your potential is endless.
